I just bought a new laptop last month. It is Gigabyte Sabre 15 with Intel Core
i7 8th, NVidia GTX 1050 mobile version, 8 GB RAM, and 1 TB HDD.

I installed Ubuntu 18.04 on it. I experienced some problems installing it and
and the most problematic one is
non-responsive keyboard after the first live boot.
